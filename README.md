# naclj

Clojure library that abstracts libsodium's C-library's crypto primitives (curve25519, ed25519, blake2b, etc.).

## Usage

Still under construction... please check back later...

## Installation

Requires the C-library libsodium to be installed.
On Mac the easiest way to install is probably through brew:

    brew install libsodium



## History

I was looking for a Clojure library to work with NaCl's primitives. First I found the Clojure library Caesium, which is layered on top of Kalium, which is a Java library layered on top of libsodium.
Unfortunately, the development on Caesium seem to have stalled. Then I tried to enhance Caesium, but the underlying Kalium forces you too much in a Java-like programming style. Then I used the foreign function interface jnr-ffi definitions from Kalium directly, and started to extend the interfaces defined for libsodium. The end result doesn't use anything from Caesium and Kalium anymore, except for a single java-file that defines the jnr-ffi "glue" between  naclj's Clojure and libsodium's C-library.
